## Features

- **One box for every link.** Paste YouTube, YouTube Music, Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, Instagram,
  TikTok, X/Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or a direct file link. The app detects what the link is and
  shows the right options.
- **Playlist and album preview.** See every track with its cover, artist and length. Tick the ones
  you want, filter by title, rename files before you download, and skip songs you already have.
- **Presets instead of settings screens.** For example: *MP3 music (square cover + tags)*, *Best
  video*, *Up to 1080p*, *Up to 720p (small)*, *Original audio (no re-encode)* and *Thumbnail only*.
- **Music with proper metadata.** Tracks from Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer are matched to
  YouTube Music (via `ytmusicapi`), then tagged with title, artist, album and square cover art.
  When a match isn't certain, the app asks you instead of guessing. You don't need a Spotify
  account or API keys: a share link is enough.
- **Galleries.** Download photo and video posts and carousels (through `gallery-dl`) with a
  grid preview.
- **A real download queue.** Run several downloads at the same time, pause, resume, cancel and retry,
  follow live speed and progress, and use *Open* / *Show in folder* when a download finishes.
- **History.** A searchable list of everything you've downloaded, with multi-select removal.
- **Self-updating engines.** When the app starts, it checks PyPI for newer `yt-dlp`, `gallery-dl`,
  `ytmusicapi` and so on, and offers them in an *Updates available* dialog, a bit like
  `apt list --upgradable`. Each update is installed into a new environment and self-tested
  before it goes live, and you can roll it back with one click.
- **Dark, responsive UI.** The layout works at small, medium and maximized window sizes.

## Download and install

### Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)

1. Go to the [**latest release**](https://github.com/AlokaWarnakula/stuff-downloader/releases/latest).
2. Download `StuffDownloader-Setup-1.2.0.exe`.
3. Run it. The installer isn't code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen may show a warning. Click
   **More info → Run anyway**.
4. Choose whether to install the optional **spotDL** engine (it's ticked by default).

Everything the app needs comes with it: FFmpeg, FFprobe, Deno and the Python engines. You don't
have to install Python or anything else.

### macOS (Apple Silicon — arm64)

**Option A — Direct download**

1. Go to the [**latest release**](https://github.com/yowunpansilu/stuff-downloader/releases/latest).
2. Download `StuffDownloader-1.2.0-macos-arm64.dmg`.
3. Open the DMG, drag **StuffDownloader** to `/Applications`.
4. On first launch, right-click the app → **Open** to bypass the Gatekeeper warning
   (the app is ad-hoc signed, not notarised).

**Option B — Homebrew**

```sh
brew install --cask yowunpansilu/stuff-downloader/stuff-downloader
```

Everything the app needs comes bundled: FFmpeg, FFprobe and Deno. You don't need to install Python or anything else.

## How to use it

1. Copy a link from your browser or a share button.
2. Click **Paste** (or press `Ctrl+V` on Windows, `Cmd+V` on macOS), then **Analyze**.
3. Pick a **preset**. For playlists and albums, tick the items you want.
4. Click **Download**. Files are saved to the folder shown under the link box. You can change
   it in **Settings**.

The **Tools** dialog shows the health of each bundled engine and has a **Check for updates** button.

## Supported links

| Source | What you get | Engine |
|---|---|---|
| YouTube / YouTube Music: videos, Shorts, playlists | Video (best / 1080p / 720p), MP3, original audio, thumbnail | yt-dlp |
| Spotify: track, album, playlist (share link) | Tagged MP3 with cover art | ytmusicapi + yt-dlp, optional spotDL |
| Apple Music, Deezer: track, album, playlist | Tagged MP3 with cover art | ytmusicapi + yt-dlp |
| Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter, Facebook, Reddit | Videos, photos, carousels | yt-dlp / gallery-dl |
| Other public video pages | Whatever yt-dlp supports for that site | yt-dlp |
| Direct file links | The file itself | built-in |

Only **public** content is supported. The app never asks for your passwords.

## Architecture

```text
┌───────────────────────────── StuffDownloader.exe (PyQt6) ─────────────────────────────┐
│  gui/        pages, queue widgets, theme            ← the only code that imports Qt     │
│  core/       router · presets · scheduler · runner · history · settings · updates      │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
               │ spawns one worker process per job, JSON-lines protocol over stdio
               ▼
   ┌─────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────┐  ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │ yt-dlp env           │  │ gallery-dl env        │  │ music env / spotDL env     │
   │ (video + audio)      │  │ (galleries)           │  │ (catalog matching, tags)   │
   └─────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────┘  └───────────────────────────┘
          each engine runs in its own versioned, hash-pinned Python environment
```

A few design decisions:

- **A worker process per job.** A crash or hang in a download engine can never freeze the UI.
  Cancelling a job kills its process tree cleanly.
- **Separate environments per engine.** yt-dlp, gallery-dl and spotDL have conflicting
  dependencies and different licences, so each one lives in its own environment under
  `envs/<engine>/<id>`. An `active.json` pointer selects the live one.
- **Safe engine updates.** An update builds a *new* environment, runs the worker self-test in it,
  and only then switches `active.json`. The previous environment is kept for rollback, and the app
  switches back automatically if the first jobs after an update all fail to start.
- **`core/` has no Qt imports.** The download logic can be tested without a GUI and reused by
  another front end (such as the macOS port).
- **Every URL is validated** (HTTPS only for network fetches, host allow-lists per site) before
  anything uses it.

## Security and reliability

- All dependencies are locked with **SHA-256 hashes** (`requirements.lock`, `requirements-dev.lock`,
  `packaging/engine-requirements/*.txt`) and installed with `--require-hashes`.
- The bundled FFmpeg and Deno binaries are **pinned by SHA-256** in `packaging/fetch_tools.py`.
- Engine updates only come from PyPI over HTTPS, and yanked and pre-release versions are ignored.
  Updates to non-yt-dlp libraries stay within the same major version.
- **1757 automated tests**: unit tests, GUI tests with `pytest-qt` (including screenshot tests of
  the layout at three window sizes), and opt-in network tests. The code is linted with `ruff`.

## Build from source

Requires **Windows** and **Python 3.11**.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/AlokaWarnakula/stuff-downloader.git
cd stuff-downloader
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements-dev.lock
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --no-deps -e .
```

Run the app and its checks:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m stuff_downloader              # start the GUI
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m stuff_downloader --self-test  # quick health check
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check src tests
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
```

After you change `pyproject.toml`, regenerate the hash-locked requirements:

```powershell
uv pip compile pyproject.toml --generate-hashes --python-version 3.11 --python-platform windows -o requirements.lock
uv pip compile pyproject.toml --extra dev --generate-hashes --python-version 3.11 --python-platform windows -o requirements-dev.lock
```

### Build the installer

You need [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php). `ISCC.exe` must be on your `PATH`, in its
default folder, or named by the `ISCC` environment variable.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe packaging\fetch_tools.py fetch          # once: ffmpeg, ffprobe, deno (SHA-256 pinned)
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe packaging\build_installer.py installer  # → dist\StuffDownloader-Setup-<version>.exe
```

The app is frozen with PyInstaller (`packaging/StuffDownloader.spec`), and the engine wheels are
staged into an offline payload that the installer sets up on first run.

## Project layout

```text
src/stuff_downloader/
  core/        URL router, presets, scheduler, worker runner, history, settings, engine updates
  gui/         main window, pages (Downloads, History, Tools, Settings), widgets, theme
  resources/   icons
packaging/     PyInstaller spec, Inno Setup script, payload and runtime builders, pinned engine requirements
tests/         unit/, gui/ (pytest-qt + screenshots), convert/, network/ (opt-in)
```

## Roadmap

- [x] YouTube video/audio, playlists, presets, queue, history
- [x] Galleries (Instagram, X, Reddit…) via gallery-dl
- [x] Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer links with no account needed
- [x] In-app engine updates with self-test and rollback (**1.2.0**)
- [x] macOS build — arm64 DMG + Homebrew cask (**1.2.0**)
- [ ] Faster failure on sites that block the connection (e.g. Reddit timeouts)
